# Working with the basics of Python

- variables
- numbers
- strings
- list
- tuples
    - are inmutable (key difference from list)
- functions
- flow control:
    - if statetments, for loop, while loop
- operators
- dictionary
- catching errors (try, except)
- reading files and writing files
- modules
    - built in modules
    - external modules  
    - pip: it's a package manager, extremely useful
        - pip install module-name
        - pip uninstall module-name
- classes and objects: create our own data type
    - object functions
- inheritance
- python interpreter: we can code and test directly in the terminal. Obviously not recommended for a real project
